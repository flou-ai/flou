# Using the Flou Studio

Now that we have created and registered our first Agents Network it's time to
play with it.

* Open the Flou Studio visiting <http://localhost:8001>  and go to the **Playground**.
* On the top right select _+ New LTM_.
* Select your newly created `MyNetwork` and _Create_.

Great! You have created the first instance of your Agents Network.

* You can see the **visual representation** of your Network.
* Navigate all the **snaphots**, i.e. the Network execution history and State.
* Execute new **transitions**.
* Visualize the **internal state**.
* Perform **rollbacks** to a previous point in time.
