# Welcome to the Flou Documentation

Here you will find everything you need to know about Flou. It's been designed to
be read in order, skipping any advanced section you may want and then be used as
reference.

The documentation is divided in the following sections:

* **[Getting Started](../getting-started/index.md)**: Get up and running with
your [first Flou project](../getting-started/first-network.md) and interacting
with it in the [Studio](../getting-started/studio.md).

* **[Network of Agents](network/index.md)**: Flou's data model. Learn how to
express your workflows with our [State Machines](network/states-machines.md),
with [nesting](network/nesting.md) and [concurrency](network/concurrency.md)
out-of-the-box.

* **[Studio](studio/index.md)**: Iterate your solution and monitor your
deployment.

* **[Orchestration Engine](engine/index.md)**: How to
[configure](engine/dependencies.md] your execution environment and run your
Network of Agents via our [REST API & CLI](engine/api-cli.md),
[websockets](engine/websockets.md).

* **[Contributing](contributing/index.md)**: Need help? Found a bug? Want to
learn more about Flou's internals? This section is for you.
